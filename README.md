# Coleoptera Anatomy Ontology (COLAO)

The Coleoptera Anatomy Ontology contains terms used for describing the anatomy and phenotype of beetles in biodiversity research. It has been built using the [Ontology Develoment Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit) with the [Ontology for the Anatomy of the Insect SkeletoMuscular system (AISM)](https://github.com/insect-morphology/aism) as a backbone. The project is open for collaboration.
